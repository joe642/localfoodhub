Local Food Hub is php application that runs on a web server to support a local food distribution hub. The food hub consolidates orders for specific distribution days where pre-ordered produce is delivered by suppliers, packed by volunteers and collected by consumers.

The full order cycle has an ordering period, a cut off date, notification of suppliers (usually 2 days before delivery to the hub) and distribution day.

This software provides the framework for producers to add products and availability, for consumers to order produce for the next distribution day and back end processing to allow the hub administrator to collate multiple consumer orders into single single purchase orders for suppliers. Distribution day processing to handle delivery, sorting, invoicing and statements.

Originally developed by Local Food Links Ltd (now Trellis Ltd) in Dorset, England, there has been further development and practical use of the system since 2009 by Stroudco (www.stroudco.org.uk).
