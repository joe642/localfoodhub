#summary Introduction to basic concepts of the food hub software.

= Summary =

The food hub system differs from a conventional on-line shop in a number of fundamental ways. A normal e-shop allows orders to be placed and then places those orders with (possibly multiple) suppliers for direct delivery. The food hub holds on to orders until the ordering phase is completed and then places consolidated orders with suppliers for delivery to the hub distribution point on the next distribution day. 

This is much better for small independent suppliers as they do not have to handle, or have the overheads associated with, multiple small orders. Suppliers can also specify limited availability and special pricing for different distribution days.

Reduced supplier overheads means reduced prices for the consumer whilst maintaining profit margins for the suppliers. The hub is funded by taking a small mark-up margin on produce sold. In the case of Stroudco this is 8%.

A vibrant food hub can help stimulate a thriving local food economy and encourage more supplies to sell locally providing more choice for consumers.

= Fundamental Concepts =

== Distribution Day ==

Distribution days are defined by the hub manager. These are the days when the hub has a physical presence, for example Stroudco operates from a local primary school on Saturdays. Orders are delivered to the hub during the morning, sorted by the hub manager and volunteers, and collected by consumers. Suppliers are paid immediately, on the day, to minimise the cash flow issues they often experience with wholesalers or other distribution channels.

== Members and Producers ==

== Order Cycle ==

Consumers can place orders up to the cut off date, which is typically 2 full days before the next distribution day. This gives time for the suppliers to prepare their orders for delivery to the hub distribution point. For Stroudco this is midnight on the Wednesday preceding the next distribution day.

Once one order period has closed then consumers accessing the site may place orders for the following distribution day (eg. 2 weeks time) even though the current one has not taken place.

After the order phase has closed (for Stroudco this is done on Thursday morning) the hub manager accesses the administration section and processes purchase orders (emailed to suppliers) and customer reminders (emailed to consumers).

On the distribution day suppliers delivery orders, these are checked and received by the hub manager and actual goods received are allocated to customers. Goods are sorted by customer ready for pick-up later in the day.
