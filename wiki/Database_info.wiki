#summary Brief explanation of tables and key fields in the database.

= Introduction =

The database schema can be found in install/foodhub.sql which is used during installation to initialise the database. This page has a summary of what the tables are used for and explanation of some of the important fields.

= Description of Database Tables =

== balance_update ==

is a log used to track changes to customer balances - helpful for debug purposes.

Used by: core_functions.php account_statement.php post_invoices.php

== calendar ==

order_date field holds the dates of distribution days.
 
Entries can be added from administration Set Up Calendar - calendar.php

See install/foodhub.sql for default values

note: volunteer discount info is not used in v1.0

== credit == 

records receipts to members account

used by core_functions.php receive_payment()

either from PayPal callback or admin Receipts - credits.php

== distribution == 

not currently used - intended to support multiple distribution sites

v1.0 supports only a single distribution site and config.use_distribution_sites must be 0

== frequency == 

stores options for distribution interval (weekly, monthly etc)

intended to support members repeat orders but redundant in v1.0 as unreliable and confusing

== infopage == 

intended to store site info pages - very basic CMS functionality

not used as assume Joomla or other CMS is used to provide info pages of the site

records members invoices when posted - post_invoice.php

== markup == 

not currently used, could support different markup for different supplier groups

currently only the single markup value in config.markup is used

== member == 

holds details of consumer members - members should be created by the administrator once they've agreed to the hub terms

member_account_balance field holds the members current balance

each member should have a unique membership_num (stroudco uses 001, 002...) 

supplier_id is a link to supplier such that this member may access the supplier control panel, multiple members may access a single supplier control panel 

== messages == 

holds hub internal messages, used for members to communicate with the hub manager

added when admin was swamped with email and sometimes missed important messages

==  orders == 

holds members orders, copied here from temp_orders when payment is made. This may be from member account balance, admin receipts or paypal callback

core_functions.php receive_payment() processes temp_orders into orders this up to the payment value 

order_current_price is the net price (minus VAT and markup) finally paid for the product - this can change in adjust invoice

order_paid_price is the net price paid when the product was ordered

during post_invoice order_paid_price and order_current_price are used to compute the new customer account balance - what they actually pay on the distribution day may be different to what they paid when ordering and their account_balance must be adjusted

order_quantity_requested is the quantity of this product the customer ordered

order_quantity_delivered is the quantity the customer recieved on distribution day
